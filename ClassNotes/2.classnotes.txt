what are conditional in python?

if
if-else
elif 

iterative flow st:
for 
while 

break
continue 
pass



#0 - sunday 
#1 - Monday
#2 - Tueday
num = int(input("Enter Number"))

if num == 0:
    print("Sunday")
elif num ==1:
    print('Monday')
elif num == 2:
    print('Tueday')
elif num ==3:

#Write a program - check given number is 3 digit number or not

Transfer Statements
===================
break
continue 
pass

pass keyword?

for x in []:
    pass 

to define
 - empty Statements
 - null Statement
 - pass the error/wont do any thing


break:keyword
We can use break Statement, inside for loop and while loop, execute based on condition.

-break: come to out from loop Statement.

continue:
========
we can use continue keyword/Statement, to skip current iteration, and contiue next iteration.

#print 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10

for x in range(1,11):
    if x == 5:
       contiue
    else:
      print(x)






break vs continue
===================
break - keyword using in loop, when ever break will execute, it come out from loop
continue - skip current iteration, and execute next iteration.

Basic Data Structure - List,Tuple,Set,Dict,String,
Fuction ->inner Fuction ->recursive Function->lambda Function->Decorators->Generators


===================================
list method:

index()
count()
append()
insert()
extend()
pop()
remove()
clear()

sort()  - homogenous list
reverse()
